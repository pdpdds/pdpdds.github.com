General
=======
  Q: What is DexOS ?
  A: DexOS is a very fast 32Bit, Single tasking, OS for 486+ PC's, written in assembly.
     There's also a ARM port in the making.

  Q: Is the sourcecode available ?
  A: Yes, full fasm sourcecode is available from the web site (see DexOS.zip).

  Q: Where can I get software for DexOS ?
  A: You will find it in the App folder in the main zip and in the download area , we collect
     all the software we and other people make for DexOS.

  Q: When I run DexOS will it do anything to my Win9x/XP/win7/Linux/BeOS installation ?
  A: No!, When you boot DexOS from a floppy or cd,USB fob, it does not touch your harddisks.

  Q: How do I shutdown DexOS ?
  A: Just hit the powerbutton, or you can type "exit", at the command prompt, if you booted
     from dos and want to go back to dos.

  Q: Will DexOS run on 486's only ?
  A: No, 486+ means 486 and higher. So, it also runs on 586's, pentiums etc...

  Q: How do I run Applications ?
  A: You can download several applictions in the download area. You can just copy these files to
     your DexOS Bootfloppy like any other file, from with in window or linux etc. Then boot the

     the menu from the GUI.

Community
=========
  Q: How can I find other people who use DexOS ?
  A: DexOS has it's own forum for users and programmers, run by jas2o. There's also a IRC or
     through mailinglists.

  Q: Where can I find DexOS users on IRC ?
  A: Server: irc.freenode.net - Channel: #dexos irc://irc.freenode.org/dexos

  Q: Can I join a DexOS mailinglist ?
  A: Yes, To subscribe, send an email with a subject of 'subscribe'to
     dexos-request@freelists.orgTo unsubscribe, send an email with a subject of 'unsubscribe'
     to dexos-request@freelists.org Once subscribed, you can email the list members by sending
     an email to dexos@freelists.org

Technical
=========
  Q: What are the SystemRequirements for DexOS ?
  A: A 486+ PC with a floppy-drive ! or CD rom or usb boot option.

  Q: Is that ALL ?!
  A: For booting DexOS, yes. Some applications may require for example a VESA2.0 compatible
     Videocard, but these requirements will be mentioned next to the download. We try to keep
     the requirements as minimal as possible so everyone should be able to run it on any PC.

  Q: Can I boot DexOS from a HD ?
  A: Yes. As in you can boot DexOS from your pre Fat16 formated hdd, using"bootprog" ,only
     from a fat16 formatted harddrive for now, As bootprog does not use fat32, which DexOS users
     for booting, But we're working on it.

  Q: Are there any plans on porting DexOS to Alpha or PPC or ...?
  A: Yes, As well as DexOS for the x86,we are working on a ARM port.

  Q: I have a MAC. Can I use DexOS ?
  A: You can't use it on a plain Macintosh. But connectix has written a PC emulator that allows
     DexOS to run on a Macintosh (Significantly slower I might add, but it works) It's called
     VirtualPC.

  Q: How about PC Emulators
  A: Members have successfully run DexOS in Qemu, Bochs, VirtualBox, DosBOX.

Programming
===========
  Q: Why program for DexOS instead of for any other Operating System ?
  A: DexOS was build for speed, and has become the fasted OS available. Another feature of
     DexOS is it's modulair architecture which has resulted in a great development platform.
     It's very easy to add or replace parts of the Operating System.

  Q: What programming languages can I use to make software for DexOS ?
  A: DexOS itself is written in pure assembley (FASM). So it's a very good platform to use
     assembly code. Also, Basic is a very good choice, As theres work on a basic like language,
     that users fasms macros to let coders write basic programs for DexOS, these will also be
     portable to the ARM ver of DexOS.

  Q: Is it hard to program for DexOS ?
  A: No, Not at all ! It's as easy as programing for dos, but with upto 4GB of memory instead of
     1MB and simpler address.

  Q: Are there any example sourcecodes available ?
  A: There is a very nice beginners tut, by solidus117, with example sourcecode, in the document
     section, also most applications and modules written by 3th parties come with full sourcecode.

  Q: I'd like to develop something for DexOS, just for fun... What's missing ?
  A: I think any thing that adds to the usability of DexOS would be good eg: games, paint
     programs, image viewers, other than BMP, debug type programs, text or gui calculator,
     drivers, vesa graphic demos to show what can be done. etc.

  Q: Where can I get help when I'm making something for DexOS ?
  A: We will help you in any way we can with system-information, URL's, documentation etc etc.
     You can also post questions or ask someone to join you in the Programming part of DexOS
     Forum.
